# User Dashboard Data Sync Fix Summary

## Problem
Orders and reservations placed by logged-in users were appearing in the "My Orders" page but not in the User Dashboard's Pre-Orders and Reservations sections.

## Root Cause
There was a data synchronization mismatch between how data was being written to Firestore vs how it was being queried:

1. **MyOrders.tsx** was querying `preOrders` collection using `where('email', '==', user.email)`
2. **useDashboardData.ts** was querying both `preOrders` and `reservations` using `where('userId', '==', user.uid)`
3. **PreOrders.tsx** was writing orders WITHOUT the `userId` field (only with email)
4. **LuxuryReservationModal.tsx** was also missing the `userId` field
5. Field name mismatches: dashboard expected `date`/`time` but some components used `pickupDate`/`pickupTime`

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added userId to Order Data (PreOrders.tsx)
```typescript
const orderData = {
  // ... existing fields
  userId: user?.uid || null // Added userId for dashboard sync
};
```

### 2. Added userId to Reservation Data (LuxuryReservationModal.tsx)
```typescript
const docRef = await addDoc(collection(db, 'reservations'), {
  // ... existing fields
  userId: user?.uid || null // Added userId for dashboard sync
});
```

### 3. Fixed Field Name Mismatches
- Updated `useDashboardData.ts` PreOrder interface: `pickupDate` → `date`, `pickupTime` → `time`
- Updated `PreOrderItem.tsx` to use correct field names
- Updated `UserDashboard.tsx` to pass correct props
- Updated `ChefDashboard.tsx` interface and display
- Updated `PreOrderStepTracker.tsx` to support 'pending' status
- Updated `whatsappService.ts` templates to use correct field names

### 4. Enhanced Status Support
- Added 'pending' status support throughout the order tracking system
- Updated status colors and progress tracking

## Data Flow After Fix

1. **Order Placement**: User places order → Written to `preOrders` collection with `userId` and correct field names
2. **Reservation Placement**: User makes reservation → Written to `reservations` collection with `userId`
3. **Dashboard Query**: `useDashboardData.ts` queries both collections by `userId` with real-time updates
4. **MyOrders Query**: Still queries by email for backward compatibility
5. **Real-time Updates**: Dashboard automatically updates when new orders/reservations are placed

## Files Modified

1. `src/pages/PreOrders.tsx` - Added userId to order data
2. `src/components/reservation/LuxuryReservationModal.tsx` - Added userId to reservation data
3. `src/hooks/useDashboardData.ts` - Fixed PreOrder interface field names and added status support
4. `src/components/dashboard/PreOrderItem.tsx` - Updated to use correct field names and support pending status
5. `src/pages/UserDashboard.tsx` - Updated props to PreOrderItem
6. `src/components/dashboard/PreOrderStepTracker.tsx` - Added pending status support
7. `src/pages/ChefDashboard.tsx` - Updated interface and field names
8. `src/services/whatsappService.ts` - Updated templates with correct field names

## Testing
- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- Real-time data sync now works between order placement and dashboard
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing data
- Orders and reservations placed by logged-in users will appear in both "My Orders" and User Dashboard sections

## Result
✅ Orders and reservations now sync properly to User Dashboard in real-time
✅ Existing "My Orders" page continues to work
✅ Field name consistency across all components
✅ Full status support including 'pending'
✅ No compilation errors
